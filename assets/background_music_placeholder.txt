For testing, you can find free background music at:

1. https://freesound.org/ (search for "game music loop")
2. https://incompetech.com/music/royalty-free/
3. https://opengameart.org/content/backgroundmusic

Download an MP3 file and save it as "background_music.mp3" in this assets folder.

For quick testing without music, you can modify the game.js file to comment out the music playing logic.
